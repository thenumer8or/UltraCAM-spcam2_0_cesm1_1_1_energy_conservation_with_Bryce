CLM build and configure directory and scripts. Scripts to help
you prepare to build CLM as a component within CESM, and setup
a namelist for it.

Important files/directories:

--------- Configure and build scripts
--------- (These scripts are also used by the cpl7 scripts)

configure ---------------- Configure script -- sets up the CPP Macro's needed to be
                           defined to build CLM
  ----- configure --help - Configure help mode -- sends information on all configure options
config_files/config_defaults.xml ----- XML file of defaults for CLM
config_files/config_defaults_*.xml --- XML file of defaults for CLM for a specific site
config_files/config_definition.xml --- XML file definining all CLM configuration items

--------- Scripts to build the namelists
--------- (These scripts are also used by the cpl7 scripts)
build-namelist --- Build the namelists needed
user_nl_clm ------ Default empty user_nl_clm copied into every case (has some notes on usage).

--------- CPL7 Script to create namelist and clm library
clm.buildnml.csh -------- Script used by CPL7 scripts to create the namelist
clm.buildexe.csh -------- Script used by CPL7 scripts to build the clm library

--------- Scripts to query namelist defaults
listDefaultNamelist.pl -- List the files needed, for a list of resolutions,
                          to run CLM that are currently NOT on your machine.
                          This file can then be used by 
                            scripts/ccsm_utils/Tools/check_input_data
                          to retreive them from the inputdata repository.
                          Setting up cases with create_newcase also does
                          this -- but only for the exact configuration
                          given. This tries to get all the files need
                          for several different resolutions and configurations
                          at once.
queryDefaultNamelist.pl - Query default namelist for settings of variables
queryDefaultXML.pm ------ Subroutines needed by queryDefaultNamelist.pl script
config_query ------------ Queries the CESM config_*.xml files (in scripts/ccsm_utils/Case.template)


--------- Test scripts directory
unit_testers ------- Directory of scripts to test scipts in this directory
                     (most notably build-namelist and possibly configure)
unit_testers/xFail - Scripts and datasets to keep track of expected failures in testing.

---------- XML Files describing namelists in namelist_files
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_clm.xml -------- List of default values for the clm namelist
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_clm_tools.xml -- List of default values for the clm tools.
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_overall.xml ---- List of default values for overall settings
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_usr_files.xml -- List of default values for the user-files
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_drydep.xml ----- List of default values for the dry deposition module.
namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml ---------- Definition of all namelist items

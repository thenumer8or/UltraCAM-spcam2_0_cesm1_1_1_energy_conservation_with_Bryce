This folder contains the files for the UM5 advectoin scheme.  05/06/2015.

0) Only one of MPDATA or UM5 schemes can be selected for a simulation.

1) To make the files inside this folder visible to the compiler, make sure the following line exists in models/atm/cam/bld/configure:
print $fh "$srcdir/atm/cam/src/physics/crm/ADV_UM5\n";

2) If UM5 is chosen as the advection scheme, the line associated with MPDATA must be commented out in the same file. Like following:
#        print $fh "$srcdir/atm/cam/src/physics/crm/ADV_MPDATA\n";
